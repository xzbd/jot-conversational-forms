##Prerequisites:

- **Youâ€™ll need to have Node >= 6 on your machine**

- Since this project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebookincubator/create-react-app), 
you should do this npm dance first

    `npm install -g create-react-app`

## How to Run:

Clone the project, `cd` to the project location and finally

 `npm start`

## Login:

You should have a valid [JotForm](https://jotform.com) account. 
Or you can use the predefined account for convenience. The credentials are: `vesax@d1yun.com` and `pass`

####Also Important:

- Conversation goes best with the [Event Feedback Form](https://form.jotformpro.com/72497810008962). This form is already created for the account provided above. 

- Of course you can talk with your other forms too but prefarably question texts should be in a proper "question form" for the best experience.

- Please note that this project is just a prototype. 

Hope you enjoy.
